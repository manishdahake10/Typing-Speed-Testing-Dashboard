# Typing Speed Testing Dashboard

## Overview
This is a **Typing Speed Test** application built using **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. It allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy in real-time. The application provides a clean, responsive, and easy-to-use interface to track typing performance.

## Features
- Real-time typing speed test (WPM - Words per minute).
- Displays accuracy percentage based on the typed text.
- Customizable typing challenge text.
- Timer to measure the typing duration.
- Visual feedback for correct and incorrect characters.
- Results are shown at the end of the test with a breakdown of speed and accuracy.
- Simple and responsive design.

## Technologies Used
- **JavaScript**: For handling typing logic, calculating speed and accuracy, and managing the timer.
- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage and creating the input fields.
- **CSS**: For styling the webpage and ensuring responsiveness.
- **Web APIs**: Uses native browser functionality for timing and input handling.

## Requirements
- A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, etc.).
